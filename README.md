## Features

- **Remote Management**: View all configured rclone remotes in a clean table interface
- **One-Click Mounting**: Mount/unmount remotes with a single click
- **Connection Testing**: Test remote connections before mounting to avoid errors
- **Auto-Mount at Startup**: Automatically mount selected remotes at system startup via crontab integration
- **Theme Support**: Toggle between light and dark themes for comfortable viewing
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear status messages and progress indicators
- **Smart Mount Points**: Automatically creates and manages mount points in user space (`~/mnt/[remote_name]`)
- **Visual Indicators**: Green highlighting for mounted remotes for quick identification
- **Folder Access**: Directly open mounted folders in your file manager
- **System Integration**: Installs as a system application with menu entry

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- rclone
- tkinter (usually included with Python)
- `mountpoint` command (available in most Linux distributions)
- FUSE (for mounting functionality)

## Installation

### 1. Install System Dependencies

First, ensure you have rclone installed and configured:
```bash
# Install rclone (if not already installed)
# Visit https://rclone.org/downloads/ for installation instructions

# Configure rclone with your remotes
rclone config
```

Then install the required system packages:

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt install python3-tk fuse util-linux
```

**Fedora:**
```bash
sudo dnf install tkinter fuse util-linux
```

**Arch Linux:**
```bash
sudo pacman -S tk fuse util-linux
```

### 2. Install Rclone GUI Manager

Clone this repository and run the installation script:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rclone-gui-manager.git
cd rclone-gui-manager
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

This will:
- Install the application system-wide to `/usr/local/bin/`
- Create a desktop entry for menu access
- Set appropriate permissions

### 3. Launch the Application

After installation, you can launch the application in any of these ways:

- **From Applications Menu**: Look for "Rclone GUI Manager" in your Utilities or System Tools
- **From Terminal**: Simply type `rclone-gui-manager`
- **Using Keyboard Shortcut**: If your system supports it, you can search for "Rclone" in your application launcher

## Uninstallation

To completely remove the application:

```bash
cd rclone-gui-manager  # Navigate to your cloned repository
chmod +x uninstall.sh
./uninstall.sh
```

This will:
- Remove system-wide application files
- Remove desktop menu entry
- Remove user configuration files (`~/.config/rclone-gui-manager/`)
- Optionally remove mount points in `~/mnt` (with user confirmation)
- Remove any rclone mount entries from crontab

Note: The source files in the repository directory will be preserved.

## How It Works

### Remote Discovery
The application reads your rclone configuration file (`~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf`) to discover all configured remotes.

### Mount Points
When mounting a remote, the application creates a directory in `~/mnt/[remote_name]` and mounts the remote there. This location is chosen to avoid permission issues.

### Mounting
Uses `rclone mount --vfs-cache-mode writes` for optimal performance and compatibility.

### Unmounting
Uses `fusermount -u` (preferred) or `umount` to unmount remotes.

### Connection Testing
Before mounting, the application tests the connection to ensure the remote is accessible using `rclone lsf`.

### Automatic Mounting
You can enable automatic mounting at startup by adding entries to your crontab with `@reboot` entries.

## User Interface

The application features a clean, modern interface with:
- A main window showing all configured remotes in a sortable table
- Status bar with clear feedback messages
- Progress indicator for ongoing operations
- Theme toggle button for light/dark mode
- Action buttons for mounting, unmounting, testing, and refreshing

Mounted remotes are highlighted in green (or dark green in dark mode) for easy identification.

## Troubleshooting

- **Mounting fails**: Check that rclone is properly configured and the remote is accessible via command line
- **Permission errors**: Ensure you have the necessary permissions to create directories in your home folder
- **FUSE issues**: Make sure `fusermount` is available in your PATH (part of fuse package)
- **Application doesn't appear in menu**: Try logging out and back in, or restart your desktop environment
- **Theme not changing**: The theme change will take effect after restarting the application
